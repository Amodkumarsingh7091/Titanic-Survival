# Titanic-Survival
# Situation
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.
On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.
While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.
In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).
# Insight
I have found 38.38% people were survived.
There were people between age 0 to 80 year old but mostly people were in age of 18 to 36 years old.
Survival ration according to age group are almost equal.
There are three Socio-economic class 1,2 and 3.
Survival ration in class 1 and 2  in more than class 3.
According to Gender survival of female is higher than male.
74.2 % of female were survived and only 25.8 % of male were survived.
# Conclusion
Most of female are survived.
